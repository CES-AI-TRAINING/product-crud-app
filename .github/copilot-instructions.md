# Copilot Instructions — Product CRUD App (Index)

This repository contains a small React + TypeScript frontend (Vite) that talks to a REST API. To keep guidance focused and easy to maintain, instructions are split into topic files below. Read the section most relevant to your task and refer to `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for higher-level context.

Instruction files (short descriptions)

- `.github/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS_GENERAL.md` — Quick start, big-picture architecture, and where to look first.
- `.github/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS_NAMING.md` — Project naming conventions and idioms (types, hooks, files, query keys).
- `.github/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS_SAFETY.md` — Safety rules, sensitive-file guidance, and repository boundaries (what not to change).
- `.github/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS_BEST_PRACTICES.md` — TypeScript & React best practices tailored to this codebase (examples + snippets).
- `.github/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS_TESTING_CI.md` — Testing patterns (Vitest/MSW, Playwright), recommended test locations, and CI expectations.

If you want, I can also add small starter files (e.g., `src/test-utils.tsx` to wrap tests with providers, or a sample GitHub Actions workflow that runs lint/typecheck/tests). Ask and I'll add them as follow-ups.
